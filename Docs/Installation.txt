                               Installation

I. CRISPR-DAV pipeline
  
    The pipeline itself can be installed by:
 
         git clone https://github.com/pinetree1/crispr-dav.git

    This would create a crispr-dav directory.

    In crispr-dav directory, all the Perl programs (*.pl) use this line to invoke 
    the perl in your environment:

         #!/usr/bin/env perl 

    Type "ls -l /usr/bin/env" to see if it is available. If not available, try 
    "which env" and then replace the shebang in all *.pl file with the right path.

    In order to run the pipeline, the following prerequisites must be installed.

II. Prerequisites

The pipeline utilizes a set of tools, most of which are common in
bioinformatics field. These include perl modules, NGS tools, R, Java, 
and Python program. 

(1) Perl modules. 

The following external uncommon modules are used by the pipeline. 

    Config::Tiny
    Excel::Writer::XLSX
    JSON
    #Bio::PrimarySeq (Part of BioPerl package) 

    Some of them may have already been installed in your system. You may use this
    command to check: 

        perl -e "use <module>", e.g. perl -e "use Config::Tiny"

    If there is no output, it means the module is already installed. Error message
	should show up if it's not installed.

    If you don't have root access, you can install a module in your local
    directory. In order for perl to search for a local module, include the
    local path in PERL5LIB environment variable.  

        export PERL5LIB=<local Path>:$PERL5LIB

    Perl's module search paths are stored in @INC. The local path in $PERL5LIB will
    be added to the front in @INC and the module will be loaded correctly. To see 
    the values of @INC, type:  

        perl -e "print join(\"\n\", @INC)"


	If you have cpanm, installing a perl module as root is simple:

        cpanm <module>, e.g. cpanm Config::Tiny
 
    If you prefer to install modules in local directory, e.g. these steps show how to 
    install Config::Tiny into local directory $HOME/perlmod.    

        wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/R/RS/RSAVAGE/Config-Tiny-2.23.tgz 
        tar xvfz Config-Tiny-2.23.tgz
        cd Config-Tiny-2.23
        perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=$HOME/perlmod
        make
        make install

	If a module is installed globally, it is already in @INC. But if it is installed 
    in a local path, you'll need to add the path to @INC by setting PERL5LIB, for 
    example, adding it to the front of pipeline script run.sh in crispr-dav directory.

        export PERL5LIB=$HOME/perlmod:$PERL5LIB

(2) NGS tools

    BWA: https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2/download 

    Samtools: https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/1.3.1/samtools-1.3.1.tar.bz2/download
        Older version of samtools is OK too.

    Bedtools2: https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/download/v2.25.0/bedtools-2.25.0.tar.gz
        Must have version bedtools2.

    PRINSEQ: https://sourceforge.net/projects/prinseq/files/standalone/prinseq-lite-0.20.4.tar.gz/download 
        Be sure to make the program prinseq-lite.pl executable: 
        chmod +x prinseq-lite.pl

    ABRA: https://github.com/mozack/abra/releases/download/v0.97/abra-0.97-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

(3) R and packages

    R software: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.2.1.tar.gz

    R packages: ggplot2, naturalsort

    To install the packages, after starting R, type:

    >install.packages("ggplot2")

    >install.packages("naturalsort")

    If you get permission errors, you may need to install R in a local directory.

(4) Java

    Java 1.7 or higher is needed to run ABRA jar file. To see java version in
    your system, type: 

    java -version

(5) Python program 

    pysamstats: https://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats 

    Check the web site for installation instructions(for root). 

    If you want to install it in your home directory, you may try these steps:

    A. Install pysam module

        pip install --install-option="--prefix=$HOME" pysam==0.8.4

    This would install pysam in $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages, assuming
    your Python version is 2.7.

	B. Install pysamstats

        git clone git://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats.git
        cd pysamstats
        python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

    This would install pysamstats executable script in $HOME/bin and
    pysamstats module in $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages.

    C. Check whether the modules can be loaded by running this:  

       $ python

       >>>import pysam
       >>>import pysamstats
       >>>exit()

    If there is no output, the installation is successful. Otherwise, try to 
    include you local library path to PYTHONPATH before trying to import. 

       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages

    If this works, be sure to include the statement in the pipeline's run.sh. 

III. Test run

    CRISPR-DAV software includes two examples. Check the README.md for test runs.
