                               Installation

I. Prerequisites

The pipeline utilizes a set of common software tools. They must be installed 
before the pipeline can be run.

(1) Perl modules. 

The following modules must be installed in paths shown in or added to the @INC array. 

    Config::Tiny
    Excel::Writer::XLSX
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
    Spreadsheet::XLSX
    Time::HiRes
    JSON
    CGI
    URI::Escape
    BioPerl modules 

To check whether a module is already installed, at command line, type:
    perl -e "use modulename", e.g. perl -e "use Config::Tiny"
If the command return nothing, it means the module is already installed.

If you don't have root access, but intend to install a module in your local directory,
you'll need to include the local path in PERL5LIB environment variable. 
    export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:<localPath>
Then the new path will be automatically shown in @INC and the module will be
loaded correctly. To see the @INC values, you may use this command:
    perl -e "print join(\"\n\", @INC)"
