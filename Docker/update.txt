### Steps to recreate docker image after code has been updated in https://github.com/pinetree1/crispr-dav
On a mac or linux (may need to be outside a firewall):

Start docker. 
Remove all local containers and images related to crispr-dav.

cd ~/temp
git clone https://github.com/pinetree1/crispr-dav
cd crispr-dav/Docker/

# Here assuming v2.2.0 is new version to be created. Change accordingly.
docker build -t pinetree1/crispr-dav:v2.2.0  .   
docker login
docker push pinetree1/crispr-dav:v2.2.0  

# now create the “latest” tag:
docker tag pinetree1/crispr-dav:v2.2.0 pinetree1/crispr-dav:latest   
docker push pinetree1/crispr-dav:latest  
This would replace the existing, if any.
