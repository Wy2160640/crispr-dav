### Case sensitive for all section names, parameters, and values

## Add a genome section to reflect the genome of interest. 
## If there are multiple genomes, each genome must have its own section.
## When amplicon sequence is used as reference, this section is ignored.

## A genome musgt have ref_fasta and bwa_idx. 
## The refGene entry is optional. It's used for visual alignment view of coding sequence.
## Absolute path must be used for genome files when a samplesheet is used to prepare run.sh. 

[genomex]
ref_fasta = genome/genomex.fa
bwa_idx = genome/genomex.fa
refGene = genome/refgenex.txt

## Required tools 

[app]

# The paths of prinseq and abra must be provided. 
# For others, if path is not provided, it must be accessible 
# in your environment  
 
abra = /bfx/app/bin/abra-0.97-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 

# Path to prinseq-lite.pl. Make sure prinseq path is executable.
prinseq = /bfx/app/bin/prinseq-lite.pl 

# bwa (e.g. 0.7.15) must support bwa mem -M, and be searchable in environment variable PATH

# samtools
samtools = /bfx/app/bin/samtools 

# Path of flash. By default use flash in PATH.
flash = /bfx/app/bin/flash2

# bedtools (e.g. v2.25) must support: bedtools intersect -F 
bedtools = /bfx/app/bin/bedtools 

# java must be 1.7 or later
java = /usr/bin/java 

# pysamstats
pysamstats = /bfx/app/bin/pysamstats 

# R must have ggplot2, reshape2, and naturalsort packages
rscript = /bfx/app/bin/Rscript 

## Filtering parameters

[prinseq]
# remove reads with quality score mean below this value (default: 30) 
min_qual_mean = 30

# remove reads with length less than this value (default: 50) 
min_len	= 50

# remove reads with percentage of Ns over this value (default: 3).
ns_max_p = 3 

[other]
# realign for large indel detection with ABRA: Y(default) or N
realign_flag = Y 

# require minimum BWA mapping quality score (default: 20) 
min_mapq = 20

# number of bases on each side of sgRNA to view base changes (default: 40) 
wing_length = 100 

# Whether to use very high resolution in plots.
# Default: 0. This creates PNG images of 72 ppi resolution. Good for web viewing.
# If set to 1, TIFF images of 1200 ppi will be created and may be good for publication.
# TIFF images may not be viewable in major web browsers, but can be opened
# using common graphics software.
high_res = 0

# To control how many cores are needed to process one sample in SGE cluster
# The list of parallel environments can be found by 'qconf -spl'
parallel_env = orte
cores_per_job = 12
